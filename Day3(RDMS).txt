Database?


Organized collection of interrelated data storee in a server/computer

ACID properties
====================
Atomicity
consistency
isolation
Durability

Relationships Types among the data to store effectively using ACId properties and retrieve easily

1. One to One RelationShip

2. One to Many

Importance of DB?
==================
-for handling large amount of different types od data with ease
-Systematically we can retrieve, filter and sort and update and efficiently and
accurately

Tpes of DB Model?
==================
defining logical structure ofthe databasr to store organize and maniplicate the data

There are 4 common types of db model
=======================================
Hierarchial DBs
Network DBs
Relational DBs
Object oriented DBs

Hierarchical DBs developed by IBM
===============
it oldest developed by IBM for information management

network DBs
=========================
Hierarchical Model + Many to many relationship
it is officially stated by CoDASYl (conference on data System Language)

Relational DBS
=====================
MYSql
DB2(IBM)
Postgre
Oracle
H2
HSQL
SQLServer etc.,

here Data is categorized in to different tables called as Relations
Each Relation or Table or Entity include set of rows and columns.
Each column holds attribute of the entity

Example
===========
Customer=>customerid,customername,customeremail,customerphonenumber etc.,

in the above example

Customer=>Entity=>Table=>Relation
customerid,customername,customeremail etc,m=>attributes of entity=>columns
values of above attributes are stored as row=>tuple=>which holds all the details of a entity as a roe
Degree of a table or Relation =>number of attribute in a table
cardinality=> no. of rows/tuples in the table


the above model generates relationships or associations like
one to one
one to many
many to one
many to many

This database follows certain rules to store the data across diffrent tables called as Normalization

Normalization helps to reduce the redundancy(repetition/duplicate)of the data(ACID)

in 1970 by E.F.Codd


Object Oriented DBs
========================
OOD follows all the principle od OOPS like class, object, inheritence,polymorphism,encapsulation and abstraction

what is DBMS?
=============
an application software to create delete,update and administer data

Components of DBMS
==================
Hardware=> Disk and Ram,keyboard, etc.,
Software=> MySql or Oracle
Data => information collected
Produce=>rules that helps in using DBMS
DB Access Language=> Query Language to perform operations like create,read,update and delete

characters of DBMS
============

DBMS supports ACID properties
it stores any kind of data like images,videos,files etc,
BackUp and Recovery
Duplicate data can be reduced 
shareing of data is easy
supports data security and restiction to unauthorized access

Application of DBMS
=====================
Banking System
Telecom
Airlines
Online shopping
Education etc,

Advantages of DBMS
==================
DBMS Duplicate data(data redundancy) is very less or not present
In DBMS data stored in consistent(Inconsistency is almost removed)
we can share data among diffrent applications and users
we can seach and featch data from diffrent servers
we can limit acces to the data by defining privileges or permissions
DBMS uses software locking mechanism that prevents the same set of data from being hanged by two people at the same time
DBMS can integrate the data business decisions
DBMS provides set or commands to reduce the time for access of data by writing simple queries using this commandds
DBMS restores the data to previous state in case of any crash 
DBMS support turning technique to improve the performance
data loss is amost eliminated
any traction to dbms will be treated atomic transation, to complete the transaction or rollback transation

DBMS disAdvanages
============
cost of hardware & software
technical staff
 managing the complexity of DB
frequeny update or manage of data


Types of dBMS
=================
NoSQL
ER Model
SQL
Document
network
Graph Database
Hierarchial DB

Normalization in DBMS
===================

Noirmalization is defined as process to remove duplicate/redundant data amound fiffrent tables to ensure data integrity.
which supports the CRUD(Create,Read update and Delete)
Noirmalization removes anomalies
  insert anamoly
  delete anamoly
  update anamoly



SQL
======
Structred Query Language

which is set of commands to manipulate the database
these set of commands are divided into 4 parts

1.DDL(data Denifinition Language)=>create or remove and change the table in databse
=============================================
create 
alter
drop
truncate
2.DML(Data Manipulation Language)=>create or removee or change values in the table
=====================================================
insert 
update
delete
3. DCL(Data Control Language)=>to set the previleges for accessing database
============================================================
grant
revoke
4.TCL (Transaction Control Language) 
======================================
=> to commit or roll back the database transactions(create,read,update and delete) of data in table
commit
rollback
savepoint

5. DQL (Data Query Language) => to retrieve the data using select statment
============================================================
select

DataTypes in MySQL
================
Numeric DataTypes
=================
int ,tinyint,smallint,mediumint,bigint,float(m,d),double(m,d),decimal(m,d),bit(m),bool,boolean
String DataTypes
=================
char(size),varchar(size),Tinytext,text,mediumtext,longtext,binary,varbinday,enum,et

BLOB (Binary Large Object Data Types)
================================
Tinybolb = 255 bytes
blob = 65,535 bytes
mediumblob = 16,777,215 bytes
longblob = 4gb

Date Data Types
=============
Year [(2|4)]  => 2 digit or 4 digit => by default 4 digits are stored
DATE => 'yyyy-mm-dd' => 1000 -01-01 to 9999-12-31
TIME => 'HH:MM:SS'
DATETIME => 'yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS'
TIMESTAMP => 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'

Constraints in MySQL
=================
rule on data 

to specify or restrict data values to store in the table

Constraints are defined on table to ensure data accuracy and integrity.

Example
=======

studentage cannot be > 120 => column level constraint


Two Types of Constraints
====================
Column level Constraints => constraints that limits to a particular column to insert particular data
Table level Constraints => constraints that are applied on entire table that limits the data insertion on whole table


List of Constraints in MySQL
======================
NOT NULL
CHECK
DEFAULT
PRIMARY KEY
AUTO_INCREMENT
ENUM
FOREIGN KEY
INDEX
UNIQUE 

Adding Constraint while creating the table
=================================
create table course(courseid int,coursename varchar(20) not null);

MySQL Engines
============

MyISAM
======
   ISAM storage (indexed sequential access method)
   SIze of the MYISAM table 256TB
   MYISAM tables compressed and readonly
  MYISAM tables are not transaction safe

MYISAM is the default engine before version 5.5
  
InnoDB
======
This is the default engine after version 5.5

supports all ACID properties
optimal for performance
it supports portablity across different platforms and OS
supports foreign keys,commit,rollback operations
SIze of the MYISAM table 64TB


MERGE
======

MEMORY(HEAP)
ARCHIVE
CSV
FEDERATED
